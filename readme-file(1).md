# Reference Resources

A curated collection of valuable resources, documentation, standards, and references across software development, cybersecurity, blockchain, and AI domains.

## Purpose

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and reference library. Instead of storing large documents directly, it maintains links to official sources along with notes and context to make finding information easier in the future.
